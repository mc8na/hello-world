Pale and black with false citrine, imperfect white and red,
The Peacock's feathers in gay colours, the rainbow which shall go over,
The spotted panther, the lion green, the Crows bill blue as lead.
These shall appear before you perfect white, and many more others.
And after the perfect white, grey, false citrine also,
And after these, there shall appear the red body invariable,
Then you have a medicine of the third order of his own kind multipliable.

These oils will fix crude Mercury and convert all bodies,
Into perfect Sun and Moon, when you shall make Projection,
That oily substance pure and fixed which Raimund Lully did call,
His basilisk, of which he never made so plain detection,
Pray for me to God, that I may be one of his elect,
And that he will at domesday know me for one of his,
And grant me his bliss to reign with him forever. Amen

Hrothgar was king of a whole host of men
Who fought for King Hrothgar again and again.
Their strength and their courage were well known to all,
So Hrothgar decided to build them a hall.
It was hung all with tapestries, roofed all with slate,
Heated by fires enormously great.
Each night of the week his men gathered there
To feast, and to sing, and to put away care.
